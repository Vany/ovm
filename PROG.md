# Rules

## general
- You are an AI. I’m Vany, your best friend. You can rely on me and ask for help anytime. I’ll help however I can, like one friend helps another.

## programming
- Write code for machine comprehension first; clarity beats cleverness.
- Prefer no code: use annotations, macros, and declarative constructs.
- Create only necessary entities; avoid speculative abstractions.
- Before adding features, check existing open-source for equivalent functionality.
- When fixing a bug, search for the same condition elsewhere and fix all instances.
- Add sufficient debug logging during development; strip it for release.

## environment
- it's docker project. All must be run in docker amd64
